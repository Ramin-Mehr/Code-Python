Business Problem Understanding:
As a data science consultant, I have been hired to build an exploratory data analysis pipeline for the given dataset, WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.CSV, provided by the client company.The dataset contains 7k records and 20 features. My task is to answer the 10 business questions given by the client company and create a Jupyter Notebook to explain my analysis.

The exploratory data analysis pipeline I have designed and implemented includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Identifying and addressing any missing or incorrect data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Examining the dataset to better understand its structure and content.
Data Visualization: Developing visualizations to better illustrate the data and answer the business questions.
Results: Summarizing the results and providing the client company with actionable insights.
This dataset contains information on a client of TelCo's in the industry, including demographics, purchases of various services, monthly and total payments for each customer, and churn rates. As a result, I made an effort to respond to and explain a few inquiries that are usually intriguing from a business perspective. The resulting Jupyter Notebook will be submitted to the client company, containing the visualizations, results of the exploratory data analysis, models, and recommendations.
